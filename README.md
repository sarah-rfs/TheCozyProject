# The project 
This project has as purpose to keep up with the progress of the developer in **Unity3D** and **Game development**.
The general idea was born because of a necessity spotted by the author of the repository of make a hude project, where she can learn and integrate every new skill , step by step, witho no worries or deadlines.
The project itself intends develop each skill at time and then integrate the previous project with the current one.
This means that if the first skill developed was make a character move, on the next step could be for instance make a objects respawn on the scene, so with this new skill (the respawn thing) will be integrate with the old one (the character movement) and be made a new version of the project where both work ok together.
That's the main reason to work with versioning and also the fact that doing this way , will be a lot easier to work with documentation.
